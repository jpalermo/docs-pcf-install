In the **UAA** pane, you configure the User Account and Authentication server.

1. Select **UAA**.

1. Under **UAA database location**, select one of the following:
  - **PAS database**: Use the same database server that other PAS components use. This system database is configured in the **Databases** pane, and it can be either internal or external.
  - **Other external database**: Use a separate, dedicated database server for UAA.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Protect whichever database you use in your deployment with a password.</p>
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> For GCP installations, Pivotal recommends using an external database on Google Cloud SQL.</p>

1. (Optional) If you selected **Other external database**, complete the fields as follows. Each field includes additional guidance for specific IaaSes and installation methods.
  * For **Hostname**, enter the hostname of the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_address` in your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `sql_db_ip` from your Terraform output. 
  * For **TCP port**, enter the port of the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_port` in the Terraform output. 
      * **GCP and GCP Terraform**: Enter `3306`. 
  * For **Username**, specify a unique username that can access this specific database on the database server. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_username` from your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `pas_sql_username` from your Terraform output. 
  * For **Password**, specify a password for the provided username. 
      * **AWS Terraform**: Enter the value of `rds_password` from your Terraform output. 
      * **GCP Terraform**: Enter the value of `pas_sql_password` from your Terraform output.
  * For **CA Certificate**, enter a certificate to use for encrypting traffic to and from the database.
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>CA certificate</strong> field only works if your external database hostname matches a name specified in the certificate. This is not true with GCP CloudSQL.</p>

1. (Optional) Under **JWT issuer URI**, enter the URI that UAA uses as the issuer when generating tokens. 

1. Under **SAML service provider credentials**, enter a certificate and private key to be used by UAA as a SAML service provider for signing outgoing SAML authentication requests. You can provide an existing certificate and private key from your trusted Certificate Authority or generate a certificate. The following domain must be associated with the certificate: `*.login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN`.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The Pivotal Single Sign-On Service and Pivotal Spring Cloud Services tiles require the <code>*.login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN</code>.</p>

1. If the private key specified under **Service provider credentials** is password-protected, enter the password under **SAML service provider key password**.

1. (Optional) To override the default value, enter a custom SAML Entity ID in the **SAML Entity ID override** field. By default, the SAML Entity ID is `http://login.YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` where `YOUR-SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is set in the **System domain** field in the **Domains** pane.

1. For **Signature algorithm**, choose an algorithm from the dropdown to use for signed requests and assertions. The default value is **SHA256**.

1. (Optional) In the **Apps Manager access token lifetime**, **Apps Manager refresh token lifetime**, **Cloud Foundry CLI access token lifetime**, and **Cloud Foundry CLI refresh token lifetime** fields, change the lifetimes of tokens granted for Apps Manager and cf CLI login access and refresh. Most deployments use the defaults.

1. (Optional) In the **Global login session maximum timeout** and **Global login session idle timeout** fields, change the maximum number of seconds before a global login times out. These fields apply to the following:
  * **Default zone sessions**:  Sessions in Apps Manager, <%= vars.product_name %> Metrics, and other web UIs that use the UAA default zones
  * **Identity zone sessions**: Sessions in apps that use a UAA identity zone, such as a Single Sign-On service plan

1. (Optional) Customize the text prompts used for username and password from the cf CLI and Apps Manager login popup by entering values for **Customize username label** and **Customize password label**.

1. (Optional) The **Proxy IPs regular expression** field contains a pipe-separated set of regular expressions that UAA considers to be reverse proxy IP addresses. UAA respects the `x-forwarded-for` and `x-forwarded-proto` headers coming from IP addresses that match these regular expressions. To configure UAA to respond properly to Gorouter or HAProxy requests coming from a public IP address, append a regular expression or regular expressions to match the public IP address.

1. (Optional) The **Client basic auth compatibility mode** checkbox governs how the UAA will process client ids/secrets when sent to the UAA in a Basic Auth header.
  * If **checked**, the UAA will not require URL-encoded client id/secret.
    * This was the behavior of the UAA prior to [v74.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v74.0.0).
    * Clients may choose to provide URL-encoded client id/secret by sending header `X-CF-ENCODED-CREDENTIALS=true`.
  * If **not checked**, the UAA will require client ids/secrets to be URL encoded as per [RFC6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).
  * It is recommended that clients URL encode basic auth credentials and send the `X-CF-ENCODED-CREDENTIALS=true` header to be compatible with either mode.
